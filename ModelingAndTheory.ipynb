    "### 7 Aspects of Database Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- massive: terabytes.\n",
    "- persistent: the data is what sits there and then program will start up, it will operate on the data, the program will stop and the data will still be there. \n",
    "- safe: hardware, software, power, users.\n",
    "- multi-user: concurrency control.\n",
    "- convenient: \n",
    "    - physical data independence, data is actually stored and laid out on disk is independent of the way that programs think about the structure of the data.\n",
    "    - high-level query language, declarative\n",
    "- efficient: thousands of queries/updates persecond.\n",
    "- reliable: 99.99999% up time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Few of Aspects Surrounding Database Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- Database applications may be programmed via \"framework\".\n",
    "- DBMS may run in conjunction with \"middleware\".\n",
    "- Data-intensive application may not use DBMS at all. e.g.: Hahoop is a processing framework for running operations on data that's stored in files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- data model: \n",
    "    - set of records. \n",
    "    - XML documents: an XML document captures data, instead of a set of records, as a hierarchical structure, of labeled values; \n",
    "    - graph data model: all data in the database is in the form of nodes and edges.\n",
    "- schema vs data: like types and variables in program language.\n",
    "- data definition data (DDL): to set up schema.\n",
    "- data manipulation/query language (DML): to query and modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key People\n",
    "\n",
    "- DBMS implementer: build system.\n",
    "- database designer: establish schema.\n",
    "- database application developer: programs that operate on database. It's not necessary to have a one-to-one coupling between database and programs. For example, have a sales database where some applications are actually inserting the sales as they happen, while others are analyzing the sales.\n",
    "- database administrator: loads data, keep running smoothly, tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relational Database\n",
    "\n",
    "- used by all major commercial databse systems\n",
    "- very simple model\n",
    "- query with high-level languages: simple yet expressive\n",
    "- efficient implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- database = set of `relations` (or `tables`). table name can be singular or palural, keep consistent.\n",
    "- each relation has a set of named `attributes` (or `columns`).\n",
    "- each `tuple` (or `row`) has a value for each attribute.\n",
    "- each attribute has a `type` (or `domain`), atomic type or structured type.\n",
    "- `schema`: structural description of relations in database.\n",
    "- `instance`: actual contents at given point of time.\n",
    "- `NULL`: special value for 'unknown' or 'undefined'.\n",
    "- `key`: attribute whose value is unique in each tuple, or set of attributes whose combined values are unique. \n",
    "    - database systems for efficiency tend to build special index structures or store the database in a particular way.\n",
    "    - if one relation in a relational database wants to refer to tuples of another, there 's no concept of pointer in relational databases. Therefore, the first relation will typically refer to a tuple in the second relation by its unique key.\n",
    "    \n",
    "```sql\n",

    "\n",
    "### Steps in Creating and Using a Relational Database\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Design schema, create using DDL;\n",
    "2. \"Bulk load\" initial data;\n",
    "3. Repeat and can be used by muti-users: execute queries and modifications;\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ad-hoc Queries in High-level Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ad-hoc: you can pose queries that you didn't think of in advance.\n",
    "- High-level: you can write in a fairly compact fashion rather complicated queries and you don't have to write the algorithms that get the data out of the database.\n",
    "- Sample query questions: \n",
    "    - some are easy to pose, some are harder;\n",
    "    - some query are more efficent, some are harder;\n",
    "    - \"Query Language\" (DML) is not only for query but also for modify;\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "/* all students with GPA > 3.7 applying to Stanford and MIT only */\n",

    "/* college with highest average accept rate over last 5 years */\n",
